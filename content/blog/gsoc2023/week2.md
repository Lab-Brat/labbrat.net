This article is a summary of all the changes made on 
[Automated Gentoo System Updater](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2023/Ideas/Automated_Gentoo_system_updater) 
project during **week 2** of GSoC.  

Project is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/Lab-Brat/gentoo_update)  


### Progress on Week 2
This week all about packaging and testing. 
The updater is still in its infancy, but it's much better to 
package everything nicely right away and not think about this in the future.

I kicked things off by bundling all the code into one directory and set it up as a Python module. 
Then, with some automation magic I whipped up a Github Actions workflow that takes care of 
publishing the package to PyPI. The idea was to make it installable using pip.

But to my surprise it turns out Python pip had it's permissions in OS severely limited after some 
recent changes. To get the package to install on the system, it demands the â€˜--break-system-packagesâ€™ 
flag. This doesn't look very user friendly ðŸ˜….

So, I took a different route and crafted an 
[ebuild](https://github.com/Lab-Brat/gentoo_update_ebuild) instead, 
which I've shipped off to the GURU 
[repository](https://github.com/gentoo/guru/tree/master/app-admin/gentoo_update). 
It's already merged to the main branch and is available for installation on Gentoo!  

Apart from packaging I also penned some unit tests for the main Python file 
and did more testing in Docker containers and VMs.

### Challenges
The hardest part undoubtedly was writing an ebuild. On paper this part sounds very straightforward - 
ebuild is just a file that tells Portage how to install the program on Gentoo. On practice, however, 
it's not very easy to do.  

First of all, a local repository needs to be set up to test it properly, I've covered it 
[here](https://labbrat.net/blog/gentoo/gentoo_guru_local/). Secondly, it's very confusing how to 
account for all dependencies. My script uses Python, Bash and also requires some system packages, 
all of which have their own dependencies. In the end, I settled on packaging Python and Bash files 
into a Python module, and then only specify dependencies for this module and additional OS 
packages in the ebuild.

Writing unit tests is also very tricky. Not only that, it also seems useless and unnecessary. For me, 
if the script passed all the test in Docker container then there is no need to write unit tests. 
However, I should also note that my Docker tests are not automated and don't cover much of the functionality, 
so probably I should focus more on writing unit tests....


### Plans for Week 3
The updater's output currently is too messy and it's all over the place. Time to tidy that up!
An important part of the project is the parser that will read and understand logs from emerge. 
I plan to start coding the parser next week.

And I can't forget â€“ I need to learn how to post blogs on Gentoo's website.
