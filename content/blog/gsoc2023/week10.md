This article is a summary of all the changes made on 
[Automated Gentoo System Updater](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2023/Ideas/Automated_Gentoo_system_updater) 
project during **week 10** of GSoC.  

Project is hosted on GitHub (
[gentoo_update](https://github.com/Lab-Brat/gentoo_update) and 
[mobile app](https://github.com/Lab-Brat/gentoo_update_flutter)), 
blog post can be also found on 
[Gentoo Blogs]().


### Progress on Week 10
I have finalized app architecture, here are the details:  

The app's main functionality is to receive notification from the push server. 
For each user, it will create a unique API token after authentication 
(there is an Anonymous option). This token will be used by gentoo_update to send 
the encrypted report to the mobile device using a push server endpoint. Update reports 
will be kept only on the mobile device, ensuring privacy.  

After much discussion, I decided to implement appâ€™s backend in Firebase. Since GSoC 
is organized by Google, it seems appropriate to use their products for this project. 
However, future plans include the possibility of implementing a self-hosted web server, 
so that instead of authentication user will just enter server public IP and port.  

Example usage will be something like:
1. Download the app and sign-in.
2. App will generate a token, 1 token per 1 account.
3. Save the token into an environmental variable on Gentoo Linux.
4. Run `gentoo_update --send-report mobile`
5. Wait until notification arrives on the mobile app.

I have also made some progress on the app code. I've decided to host it in 
another [repository](https://github.com/Lab-Brat/gentoo_update_flutter) because it 
doesn't require direct access to `gentoo_update`, and this way it will be easier to 
manage versions and set up CI/CD.  

Splitting tasks for the app into `UI` and `Backend` categories was not very 
efficient in practice, since two are very closely related. Here is what I have done 
so far:
* Create an app layout
* Set up Firebase backend for the app
* Set up database structure for storing tokens
* Configure anonymous authentication
* UI elements for everything above

### Challenges
I'm finding it somewhat challenging to master the use of Flutter and design an 
modern-looking app. My comfort zone lies more in coding backend and automation tasks 
rather than focusing on the intricacies of UI components. Despite these challenges, 
I am 60% sure that in end app will look half-decent.  

### Plans for Week 11
After week 11 I plan to have a mechanism to deliver update reports from a 
Gentoo Linux machine.
