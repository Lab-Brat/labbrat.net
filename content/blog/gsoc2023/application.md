In this article I want to share my experience in applying to 
Google Summer of Code 2023 (GSoC). I was lucky enough to get 
accepted and I hope that this article will help someone in 
their future applications.  

**Disclaimer**: This article is not a guide on how to get accepted, 
it's just my journey and my thoughts on the process. The outcome 
depends on your skills, organization, the project idea, Google and 
most importantly - luck.  

Let's start with what GSoC is all about.  


### Is GSoC for me?
It's for you if:
* You know how to code, but you don't have much experience with it.
* You want to contribute to open source projects.
* You want to lean how to communicate with open source communities.
* You want a pretty thing on your resume.
* You want to network with fellow tech people.

It's not for you if:
* You want to get paid well.
* You want to get a job.
* You already have extensive professional programming experience.
* You already are an open source contributor.

By the time I decided to apply for GSoC2023 I already had 
2 years experience in a sysadmin role, but I had a very limited 
programming experience. I knew a bit of Python and Bash, but 
didn't know how to write a proper program or collaborate with other 
developers on a project.  

I wanted to learn how to code and I wanted to contribute to open source 
so I decided to apply!  


### How to choose an organization?
It's actually very simple - **don't try to be someone you are not!**  

I work with Linux on my job everyday and use Gentoo on my personal laptop. 
Honestly I think it's the best thing that came out of computer science field 
thus far, and could talk about it for days.

So for me the choice of organization was obvious - anything related to Linux.  

I ended up choosing Gentoo Foundation mainly because of shared passion 
for rolling release distros and because Gentoo is iconic.  


### How to apply?
[Official documentation](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules#:~:text=from%20the%20Program.-,GSoC%20Contributors.,-Eligibility.) 
is a better place to read about the detailed 
guide on how to apply. Here I will just talk about some aspects I 
found to be the most crucial.  

#### Communication
Definitely the most important part of the application process. Find 
which tools organizations prefers for communication, for Gentoo it's 
IRC chats (my IRC setup is described [here](https://labbrat.net/blog/irc_chats/)), 
then add yourself to all the appropriate channels and start talking 
to everyone! Opensource communities are generally very friendly and 
welcoming and will be more than happy to answer all your questions.  

#### Contributions
Some organizations require you to make a contribution one of their 
projects. This is a very fair requirement, because it tests your 
ability with `git` and the general ability to identify and fix issues.  

It doesn't have to be a very complex contribution. For example, during 
me application I uploaded some packages to Gentoo's GURU repository, 
and bumped the version of some existing ones. If you don't know what to 
contribute - just ask the community!  

#### Proposal
A good proposal is based on feedback. Decide on a project idea as soon as 
possible and ask the project mentor to review your proposal. It's a 
standard practice in most of the organizations and they will be happy 
to do it, but it keep in mind that mentors are usually very busy so 
it might take some time.  

Everything above has to be done as early as possible. I'd say whenever 
the list of organizations is published it's time to start contacting 
the communities and discuss projects.  

I started to work on my proposal 1 month before the official application 
period, which gave me a plenty of time write it and received multiple 
revisions from the project mentor.  


### Result
After contacting the community, discussing project idea with the mentor, 
doing some contributions, writing and submitting a proposal there is nothing 
else you can do but wait.  

Organization after receiving all proposals will rank them internally. Then, 
a request will be sent to Google for a certain number of slots 
(basically a number of projects they want to host). Google will 
most likely give an organization a bit less slots than they requested, 
and this is where the initial ranking comes in.  

A regular contributor won't play a part in this whole process and 
can just patiently wait for about a month for both side to make their 
decision.

Good luck with your application! And feel free to reach out to me if 
you will have any questions ðŸ˜Œ
