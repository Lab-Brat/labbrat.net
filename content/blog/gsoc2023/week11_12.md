### Progress on Weeks 11 and 12
During the 2 weeks I've completed app UI and Firebase backend. 
Most of the work is done!  

Here is a demo how everything works together:

Here is how the Firebase backend works:
Cloud Functions (NodeJS) + Cloud Messaging + Firestore + Security Rules  

Here is how I plan to implement and move to a custom backend:
Linux + Docker Compose + Python/Django REST API + MongoDB + Nginx


### Challenges


### Plans for Week 13 (final week ðŸŽ‰)
Here is my plan for the final week of GSoC:
1. Add encryption to the Firestore. I don't want any user data to be stored in plain text.
2. Improve some UI elements and add a pop-up with commands to copy/paste.
3. Publish mobile app to Playstore.
4. Upload an ebuild with latest version of the `gentoo_update`.
5. Write a detailed blog post on how to use the whole thing.
6. Writa a post on forums.
