### About me
My life in one sentence =====> doing tech with questionable efficiency.  
My life in many sentences ===v

```
>>> I'm a swiss-army-knife engineer, 
    because currently my job is a fusion of 
    * Linux Administration
    * DevOps
    * Support (tech and emotional)
    * Python programming.

>>> I was born in China, where I lived and studied for 25 years. 
    Now I am all over the place.

>>> I like chess and sports on an extremely rare occasion.
    But I'm most passionate about doing things with computers.
